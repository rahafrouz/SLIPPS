          <h6 className="about-content">SLIPPS is responding to the challenge to improve European patient safety competence and education. Errors, mishaps and misunderstandings are common and around 1 in 10 patients suffer avoidable harm (WHO 2014). The majority of adverse care episodes and near misses are preventable (Vlayen et al 2012) and such incidents impact upon patients, their families, health care organisations, staff and students.

In health care programmes, learning takes place in both academic and work placement settings (Pearson et al 2009, 2010, Steven et al. 2014). When participating in clinical practice learning, student healthcare professionals may witness or be involved in patient safety incidents of varying degrees which are not always recognised, recorded or challenged (Steven et al 2014,  Kiesewetter et al 2014, Felstead 2013, Henneman et al. 2010). Thus a valuable source of information about patient safety incidents remains untapped and potential learning opportunities are lost.</h6>

Stronger collaboration is needed to improve the culture of safety in clinical teaching and learning settings (Tregunno et al. 2014) and to alleviate tensions between academic and work place contexts which may negatively impact upon student learning (Steven et al. 2014). </h6>
